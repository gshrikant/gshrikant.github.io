                    <p>It was one of our longer sessions (3 hours) and a
                    few interesting events happened.</p>
                    <p>Last session the party had arrived Phandalin back
                    from a daring stealth rescue mission. They had
                    managed to infiltrate the Cragmaw tribe’s stronghold
                    deep in the treacherous Neverwinter Wood and take
                    out their leader, King Grol, while rescuing their
                    friend, Gundren Rockseeker. In Cragmaw Castle they
                    ran into an unexpected ally in the form of Halia
                    Thornton of the Phandalin’s Miner’s Exchange.</p>
                    <h3 id="arson-at-stonehill-inn">Arson at Stonehill
                    Inn</h3>
                    <p>As the travellers trudge into town they witness a
                    terrible sight. The charred remains of the building
                    that housed the Stonehill Inn stood before them.
                    Asking around the town revealed that this was the
                    retribution for the party’s actions against the
                    Redbrand guards a couple of weeks ago. The Redbrands
                    had raided the Inn late at night and not only
                    brutally executed Thurn, the woodworker the party
                    had saved from a public execution but set fire to
                    the Inn itself as they left.</p>
                    <p>Toblen Stonehill (the inn’s proprietor) didn’t
                    have any rooms for them to rent but offered them a
                    place in his own living quarters for a few days and
                    cautioned them to leave as soon as they can to avoid
                    inviting further trouble.</p>
                    <h3 id="phandalins-defenders">Phandalin’s
                    Defenders</h3>
                    <p>The adventurers then headed down to Halia’s home
                    where they discovered Halia, Sildar and the
                    townmaster, Harbin Wester, in a serious discussion.
                    Halia was sent to negotiate with the Cragmaws in the
                    hope that they would turn against Lord “Glass Eye”
                    Albrek and weaken his tyrannical rule. That plan
                    fell through when the party killed King Grol to
                    rescue Gundren.</p>
                    <p>When the party joined the discussions Sildar and
                    Harbin were planning a negotiation with the Redbrand
                    captain (“Greenfinger”) at the Sleeping Giant.
                    Sildar warned that they should also expect
                    retaliation from the Cragmaws after recent events.
                    As other town leaders (Darren Edermath and Quelline
                    Alderleaf) joined the meeting a plan began to take
                    shape.</p>
                    <p>The party, led by Gregory, took the lead in
                    formulating a defense plan against the goblinoid
                    invasion. Halia and Darren would mobilize a small
                    group of miners and lead an active defense force to
                    block off the Triboar Trail.</p>

                    <p>As they exited the inn the group noticed a group

                    distance.</p>
