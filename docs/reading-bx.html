                    <h2>2022-10-10</h2>
                    <p>I’ve been doing a deep-dive into the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision">D&amp;D
                    Moldvay Basic</a> rules in an attempt to learn an
                    old-school fantasy roleplaying ruleset. While my
                    eventual goal is to start a campaign set in a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_Earth">Dying
                    Earth</a> inspired world of my own I’ve decided to
                    start small and focus on learning to run a good
                    dungeon-crawl.</p>
                    <p>I’m a late-comer to the world of roleplaying
                    games (RPGs) having started with <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Cthulhu_(role-playing_game)">Call
                    of Cthulhu</a> in the December of 2019. Since then
                    I’ve run 5 sessions of Call of Cthulhu before
                    starting a Dungeons and Dragons (5e) campaign from
                    the starter set (<em>Lost Mines of Phandelver</em>)
                    in May 2020. We played biweekly for about 6-8 months
                    but we never ended up finishing that game. Around
                    that same time I’d signed up for 5e campaign at work
                    (also based on a pre-written module, <em>Princes of
                    the Apocalypse</em>) which ended last month after ~2
                    years.</p>
                    <p>During this period I played in a variety of
                    one-off games in different systems online and
                    in-person but none of them materialized into a group
                    that could evolve into a proper campaign. At the
                    same time I dove into tabletop roleplaying discourse
                    online (Reddit, various forums and blogs) which
                    introduced me to the different schools of thought
                    that existed in this hobby and gave me much to think
                    about my own preferences.</p>
                    <p>Lately, however, I’ve been feeling dissatisfied
                    with my participation in the hobby. I’ve been
                    looking for deeper, more active involvement - one
                    based on solid creative thought and substance. The
                    kind, which, in my opinion, superficially skimming
                    dozens of rulesets or playing in one-off games just
                    cannot offer.</p>
                    <p>So I’ve decided to return to the basics. My
                    ruleset of choice is the Basic/Expert (1981) D&amp;D
                    which seems appropriate given my limited experience.
                    My goal is to familiarize myself with the rules
                    enough to run a fun dungeon-crawl fully by-the-book.
                    This means everything from tracking turns and
                    resources (light sources, arrows and rations),
                    wandering monster checks, reaction, morale and
                    loyalty checks, listening at and forcing open doors,
                    combat phases etc. I don’t expect to be perfect
                    right off the bat but I’m hoping to master enough of
                    the system to realize it when I (inevitably) forget
                    a rule or apply it wrong.</p>
                    <p>The next step, as the old-school wisdom tell us,
                    is to draw up a dungeon for your players to explore
                    and I intend to do just that. A mistake I’ve made
                    with this step in the past is spending a lot of time
                    thinking of new traps, monsters and tricks in an
                    attempt to make the dungeon “unique” or special. Not
                    only does this suck up my limited creative energy
                    and free time, the resulting burnout means I have a
                    small pile of unfinished “idea” dungeons that I
                    never ended up fully keying (let alone playing).</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I’ve decided to keep my first dungeon
                    a simple, workmanlike affair. It will have goblins,
                    maybe some undead, fire beetles and giant rats. It
                    will have a deadly trap or two to keep players on
                    their toes and a simple puzzle that will require
                    them to interact with the environment (eg. turn a
                    statue to unlock a locked door like Holmes’ <a
                    href="https://sites.google.com/site/zenopusarchives/home/modules-and-scenarios/the-sample-dungeon">“Sample
                    Dungeon”</a>) and treasure rolled up using the
                    by-the-book rules. The map needs to be
                    straightforward with a few loops and a little three
                    dimensionality. <a
                    href="https://guccifuligincloak.blogspot.com/2020/05/so-you-want-to-run-osr-part-1-preparing.html">20
                    rooms</a> for the first floor should suffice.</p>
                    <p>With all that said, like any other project, I
                    think a little accountability would help keep things
                    on track and keep me from getting stuck. I’m hoping
                    that writing about my progress on this blog would do
                    that for me in some small capacity. Next time, I
                    hope to post some of my observations from reading
                    the rulebook (particularly, things that I think I
                    would likely forget while running my first game) as
                    well as an initial idea about the ‘first’
                    dungeon.</p>
