                    <h1>Debugging USB with TinyFPGA BX</h1>
                    <h2>2021-07-04</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to write a note on a quick debug session
                    to get my TinyFPGA BX board working with my T450s
                    running Debian Sid (unstable). The board doesn’t
                    come with a separate USB controller (typically a
                    FTDI chip or a microcontroller running a USB stack).
                    Instead it loads a bootloader design from its QSPI
                    flash which then presents a CDC class USB device to
                    the host computer which shows up as a
                    <code>/dev/ttyACMn</code> device.</p>
                    <p>When connected to a USB host - detected by a USB
                    Start of Frame (SoF) packet the bootloader waits for
                    host commands without exiting. This is indicated by
                    blinking the onboard LED. When I plugged the device
                    in, however, the LED came on and blinked for all of
                    4 seconds before turning off at which point the
                    device disconnected. I tried using TinyFPGA’s
                    <code>tinyprog</code> programming tool after
                    resetting the board only to discover another process
                    holding the device node file open.</p>
                    <p>This turned out to be ModemManager (thanks
                    <code>lsof</code>) a Network Manager sub-program
                    designed to talk to USB modems using AT commands.
                    The bootloader doesn’t seem to like this and exits
                    causing the device to “disconnect”. After stopping
                    and disabling the <code>modemmanager</code> service
                    via <code>systemctl</code> I was hoping that it
                    would fix my bootloader troubles but unfortunately
                    that didn’t seem to have made a difference. The
                    bootloader LED still turned off after blinking for
                    about 4-5 seconds followed by the device
                    disconnecting with the following log messages in
                    <code>dmesg</code>:</p>
                    <pre><code>usb 2-1: New USB device found, idVendor=1209, idProduct=2100, bcdDevice=0.00
usb 2-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=0, SerialNumber=0
cdc_acm 2-1:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
usb 2-1: USB disconnect, device number 9</code></pre>
                    <p>I wasn’t sure if the fault lay with the board,
                    the USB cable, the laptop hardware (USB host
                    controller) or with the host software. I tried
                    plugging in the device into a Ubuntu 18.04 desktop
                    to see if my board worked and it did! That
                    eliminated the board as a possible suspect. The next
                    experiment I did was to disable USB driver
                    autoprobing and see if the bootloader still exited
                    after a few seconds. Surprisingly, this time around
                    the LED kept happily blinking away! This eliminated
                    the cable and host USB hardware from the running.
                    The problem lay with the interaction of the system
                    software and the port.</p>
                    <p>The next step took a little while but Google led
                    me to <code>usbmon</code> which is a Linux kernel
                    module for sniffing USB packets. Since I now had a
                    working case (<code>driver_autoprobe</code> set to
                    0) and a non-working case I could compare the
                    packets transmitted in both cases to try to figure
                    out what went wrong in the latter. Although
                    <code>usbmon</code> exposes a text interface via
                    <code>debugfs</code> which captures raw transmitted
                    USB packets for each bus I found it was much easier
                    to use Wireshark (which I was surprised to find
                    works for USB packet sniffing too!).</p>
                    <pre><code>$ grep CONFIG_USB_MON /boot/config-$(uname -r) &amp;&amp; modprobe usbmon
$ sudo wireshark &amp;</code></pre>
                    <p>At this point we can start sniffing USB packets
                    once we know the bus that our device is on which we
                    can figure out by looking the <code>dmesg</code>
                    output. For example, in the <code>dmesg</code>
                    snippet above the device is on bus 2 which means we
                    need to look at transactions over
                    <code>usbmon2</code> in Wireshark.</p>
                    <p>Some more digging and a searching revealed that
                    <em>something</em> was suspending power to the port
                    that the board was connected to. That something then
                    turned out to be TLP - a power management daemon for
                    Thinkpads that can autosuspend USB ports (runtime
                    power management) when they are inactive.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, there is an option to exclude
                    specific USB devices from TLP’s runtime power
                    management based on their vendor and product ID
                    tuple. I added the TinyFPGA’s VID:PID under
                    <code>USB_BLACKLIST</code> in
                    <code>/etc/default/tlp</code> and restarted the TLP
                    service for good measure and the bootloader LED
                    happily blinked away!</p>
