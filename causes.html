	<h2>Causes<hr></h2>
	<p>I support a few organizations for the causes they represent and their
	active work in promoting these issues. I've listed below their names
	with a short description about why I think their work is valuable.</p>

	<hr width="15%">

	<h3><a href="https://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a></h3>

	<p>Even before I knew about the FSF, I was already using their
	<a href="https://gnu.org">work</a>. The FSF stands for the democratization
	of the software we write and use. For more than 30 years, they have led
	what is called the Free Software Movement -- an effort to move towards
	a computing future where the software that we run on our computers is
	not locked down or otherwise changed without our control.</p>

	<p>This is only achievable through software 'freedom', the ability to use
	your software with complete control over all parts it. The FSF has been
	working on creating a completely free (as in freedom) operating system
	infrastructure under what is known as the GNU Project. Fortunately, they
	they have succeeded in large part.</p>

	<p>A reasonable way to support them would be to donate to them. But that
	holds little value towards helping the cause they stand for. I believe,
	the real value lies in using, promoting and possibly writing software
	which gives users more freedom in using it.</p>

	<hr width="25%">

	<h3><a href="https://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a></h3>

	<p>I doubt this needs more explanation but here is one anyway. I've known
	Wikipedia as long as I've known the internet. Early on, it was the site
	where I ended up after searching for any topic. Now, it the definitive
	for a wealth of information difficult to find otherwise. I am confident
	that it would morph into a cultural, technological and historical time
	vault in the future.</p>

	<p>I can't count the number of times Wikipedia has made me feel like
	an expert on a topic overnight (usually before exams). It is difficult
	to imagine, therefore, that it is a <em>free</em> resource, collated
	by tens of thousands of knowledgeable people from around the world.
	It is the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria">Library of
	Alexandria</a> of our times, only wider and more accessible.</p>

	<p>More importantly, Wikipedia represents free information - a resource
	as valuable as oil but probably not as dangerous for humans! The growth
	of Wikipedia serves as an example to what people can achieve through
	collaboration given the freedom to do so.</p>
