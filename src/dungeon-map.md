Short post to share a quick dungeon map. The map layout is fairly basic - more
in style of [Mike's
Dungeons](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/295151/Mikes-Dungeons) and the
Holmes' Sample Dungeon than anything else. Although I have a few starting ideas
I haven't gotten around to actually keying this map yet.

I'll post the key separately once I have something worth sharing.
