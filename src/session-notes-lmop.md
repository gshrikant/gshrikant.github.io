## Party

* Gregory, human Cleric (3)
* Aaravas, half elf Paladin (3)
* Pio, half elf Rogue (3)

## Summary

It was one of our longer sessions (3 hours) and a few interesting events
happened.

Last session the party had arrived Phandalin back from a daring stealth rescue
mission. They had managed to infiltrate the Cragmaw tribe's stronghold deep in
the treacherous Neverwinter Wood and take out their leader, King Grol, while
rescuing their friend, Gundren Rockseeker. In Cragmaw Castle they ran into an
unexpected ally in the form of Halia Thornton of the Phandalin's Miner's
Exchange.

### Arson at Stonehill Inn

As the travellers trudge into town they witness a terrible sight. The charred
remains of the building that housed the Stonehill Inn stood before them. Asking
around the town revealed that this was the retribution for the party's actions
against the Redbrand guards a couple of weeks ago. The Redbrands had raided the
Inn late at night and not only brutally executed Thurn, the woodworker the
party had saved from a public execution but set fire to the Inn itself as they
left.

Toblen Stonehill (the inn's proprietor) didn't have any rooms for them to rent
but offered them a place in his own living quarters for a few days and
cautioned them to leave as soon as they can to avoid inviting further trouble.

### Phandalin's Defenders

The adventurers then headed down to Halia's home where they discovered Halia,
Sildar and the townmaster, Harbin Wester, in a serious discussion. Halia was
sent to negotiate with the Cragmaws in the hope that they would turn against
Lord "Glass Eye" Albrek and weaken his tyrannical rule. That plan fell through
when the party killed King Grol to rescue Gundren.

When the party joined the discussions Sildar and Harbin were planning
a negotiation with the Redbrand captain ("Greenfinger") at the Sleeping Giant.
Sildar warned that they should also expect retaliation from the Cragmaws after
recent events. As other town leaders (Darren Edermath and Quelline Alderleaf)
joined the meeting a plan began to take shape.

The party, led by Gregory, took the lead in formulating a defense plan against
the goblinoid invasion. Halia and Darren would mobilize a small group of miners
and lead an active defense force to block off the Triboar Trail.

### Negotiations at the Sleeping Giant


### Standoff

As they exited the inn the group noticed a group of four scarlet cloaked men
following them at a distance.

### Notes
* Charisma saving throw.
* Side initiative
