      <description>I wanted to write a note on a quick debug session to get my TinyFPGA BX board working with my T450s running Debian Sid (unstable). The board doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with a separate USB controller (typically a FTDI chip or a microcontroller running a USB stack). Instead it loads a bootloader design from its QSPI flash which then presents a CDC class USB device to the host computer which shows up as a /dev/ttyACMn device.</description>

      <description>Party  Gregory. Human Cleric (Life) Aaravas. Half Elf. Paladin (Oath of the Ancients) Pio. Half Elf. Rogue (Arcane Trickster)  Summary Date: 23 May 2021
It was one of our longer sessions (3 hours) and a few interesting events happened.
Last session the party had arrived in Phandalin back from a daring stealth rescue mission. They had managed to infiltrate the Cragmaw tribe&amp;rsquo;s stronghold deep in the treacherous Neverwinter Wood and take out their leader, King Grol, while rescuing their friend Gundren Rockseeker.</description>
