      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a deep-dive into the D&amp;amp;D Moldvay Basic rules in an attempt to learn an old-school fantasy roleplaying ruleset. While my eventual goal is to start a campaign set in a Dying Earth inspired world of my own I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start small and focus on learning to run a good dungeon-crawl.
I&amp;rsquo;m a late-comer to the world of roleplaying games (RPGs) having started with Call of Cthulhu in the December of 2019.</description>

      <title>Debugging USB with TinyFPGA BX</title>

      <description>I wanted to write a note on a quick debug session to get my TinyFPGA BX board working with my T450s running Debian Sid (unstable). The board doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with a separate USB controller (typically a FTDI chip or a microcontroller running a USB stack). Instead it loads a bootloader design from its QSPI flash which then presents a CDC class USB device to the host computer which shows up as a /dev/ttyACMn device.</description>

      <description>Party Gregory, human Cleric (3) Aaravas, half elf Paladin (3) Pio, half elf Rogue (3) Summary It was one of our longer sessions (3 hours) and a few interesting events happened.
Last session the party had arrived Phandalin back from a daring stealth rescue mission. They had managed to infiltrate the Cragmaw tribe&amp;rsquo;s stronghold deep in the treacherous Neverwinter Wood and take out their leader, King Grol, while rescuing their friend, Gundren Rockseeker.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of the number of times I&amp;rsquo;ve redone my website over the years not to mention the number of times I&amp;rsquo;ve switched between blogging and static website hosting platforms. Hopefully, this iteration can hang around for a while before I inevitably scrap it in favour of something else. Welcome back!</description>
